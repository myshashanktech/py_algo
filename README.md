## Python Algorithms

This website is an implementation of various algorithms which are needed while learning Python .
Certain Algorithms which are required:-
1. [Stack]()
2. [Queues]()
3. [Lists]()
4. [Dictionaries]()
5. [Linked lists]()
6. [Trees]()
7. [Graphs]()

You can add yours as well in order to learn more. This world consists of variety of algorithms.

I would like some various Machine Learning Algorithms which are certainly divided into :-
* Supervised Learning Algorithms
* Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Supervised can be generally categorised into categories which have input as well as Outputs which are classified into:-
* Linear Regression
* Classification
* Logistic Regression 
* Naive Bayes
* K Nearest Neighbours
* Multiple Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Neural Networks

While, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms can be classified into:-

* K Means Clustering
* Heirarchial Clustering
* Hidden Markov
* Gaussian Mixture
* Neural Networks
